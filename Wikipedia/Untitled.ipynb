It established the freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. The empire\\'s [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional era]], was short-lived. But the idea of [[Ottomanism]] proved influential. A group of reformers known as the [[Young Ottomans]], primarily educated in [[Western world|Western]] universities, believed that a [[constitutional monarchy]] would give an answer to the empire\\'s growing social unrest. Through a [[military coup]] in 1876, they forced Sultan [[Abd\\\\\\'fclaziz]] (1861\\\\\\'961876) to abdicate in favour of [[Murad V]]. However, Murad V was mentally ill and was deposed within a few months. His heir-apparent, [[Abd\\\\\\'fclhamid II]] (1876\\\\\\'961909), was invited to assume power on the condition that he would declare a constitutional monarchy, which he did on 23 November 1876. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. When forced to reconvene it, he abolished the representative body instead.
